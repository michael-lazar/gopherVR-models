# gopherVR-models

This repo contains reproductions of the 3D models from the [GopherVR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GopherVR) project, developed by University of Minnesota in 1995. 

The historical GopherVR source code is hosted here: [gopher://gopher.floodgap.com/1/gophervr](https://portal.mozz.us/gopher/gopher.floodgap.com/1/gophervr).

The 3D objects were originally modelled in c code using [libvogl](https://www.autochthonous.org/eric/), which is an old, obsolete graphics library that's very difficult to find information on. I converted them to [.obj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) files using some terrible regex strings and elbow grease. There are many free tools online that you can use to view obj files, such as [https://3dviewer.net/](https://3dviewer.net/).
